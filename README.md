# Liar's Dice

A repository to simulate runs of Liar's Dice.

This repository was set up as a supplement for [this blog post](https://mattdodge.codes/statistical-look-at-liars-dice/) but could really be used for any Liar's Dice simulations.

## Running

To run simulations:

```bash
python main.py
```

To use the Jupyter notebook version for faster iteration:

```bash
pip install jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

## Requirements

 * Python 3.4+
 * Jupyter
 * Plotly (for plotting)

```
pip install jupyter plotly
```
